### Tuts+ Tutorial: Monitor and control applications using Supervisor

#### Instructor: Shalabh Aggarwal

Supervisor is a monitoring tool which controls various child processes and handles starting/restarting of these child processes when they exit abruptly or exit due to some reasons. It can be extended to control the processes via XML-RPC API over remote locations without logging in to the server. I will cover the XML-RPC API in the second part of this two part series.
